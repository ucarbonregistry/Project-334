PSIPL has installed three nos. each of 11.5 TPH WHRB to utilize sensible heat of flue gases emitting
from Rotary Kiln along with one 7.1 MW turbo generator to fulfil the captive requirement of the plant.
The proposed 7.1MW Captive Power Plant (CPP) will be of 3 boilers – one steam turbine arrangement.
The condenser shall be Air cooled condenser. Power generated from the generator at 11kV will be
connected to the Iron & Steel plant, after drawl for the CPP’s auxiliary power requirements.
The plant will have three numbers of 11.5TPH WHR boiler and one 7.1MW turbo generator. Besides
the above, the plant will have Air cooled condenser, Ash handling system, auxiliary Cooling tower,
Pumps, Water treatment plant, Fire protection system, Air compressors, Air conditioning and Ventilation
system, Electrical system. and instrumentation & controls.
Waste Heat Recovery Boiler
The Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) based Captive Power Plant is installed at PSIPL site to utilize the heat
content of flue gases coming out of Rotary Kiln. There are three 11.5 TPH WHR Boiler for 7.1 MW
power generation. Each boiler will be a vertical, 3 pass, natural circulation, fully drainable, gas tight
membrane casing, water tube boiler for continuous operation and out-door installation.
